# UX

## UX Design

The color scheme used in this project is a deviation from the basic "Achromatic" use of a white background with black text in web design yet the motifs were simply structured to be aesthetic and user friendly. All sections are arranged in a logical order to provide intuitive user experience.

The following colors were used: blanchedalmond (`#ffebcd`), range of blue-grey (`#263238`, `#37474f`, `#78909c`), grey lighten-5 (`#fafafa`), amber accent-4 (`#ffab00`), green accent-4 (`#00c853`), red lighten-1 (`#ef5350`), moderate red (`#D05F59`), white (`#ffffff`), black (`#000000`) and very dark (`#121315`).

## Target Audience

This application aims to attract readers, voracious readers, who like to share their thoughts on books they have read, and interact with other readers. The website provides user with synopsis about various genres and reviews, and allows interface for their reactions. Users are also able to upvote or downvote reviews. 

The main objective of the website is to provide users with the functionality to read, add, comment and vote for reviews.
