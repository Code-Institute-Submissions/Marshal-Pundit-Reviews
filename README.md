# UX

## UX Design

The color scheme used in this project is a deviation from the basic "Achromatic" use of a white background with black text in web design yet the motifs were simply structured to be aesthetic and user friendly. All sections are arranged in a logical order to provide intuitive user experience.

The following colors were used: blanchedalmond (`#ffebcd`), range of blue-grey (`#263238`, `#37474f`, `#78909c`), grey lighten-5 (`#fafafa`), amber accent-4 (`#ffab00`), green accent-4 (`#00c853`), red lighten-1 (`#ef5350`), moderate red (`#D05F59`), white (`#ffffff`), black (`#000000`) and very dark (`#121315`).

## Target Audience
